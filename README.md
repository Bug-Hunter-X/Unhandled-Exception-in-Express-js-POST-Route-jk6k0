# Unhandled Exception in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled exceptions when processing request bodies.  The `bug.js` file contains code that crashes if the request body is missing a required field ('name' in this case). The solution in `bugSolution.js` addresses this by adding robust error handling and input validation.
